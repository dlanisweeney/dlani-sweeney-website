        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm D'Lani Sweeney, and I'm passionate about doing my own nails! This website is dedicated to sharing more about doing your own gel-x nails at home.</p>
        
        <p>I started being interested in doing my own nails since my freshman year of college. I moved away from home and my usual nail spot and realized that when you add it up, it costs a lot of money to regularly get your nails done at a salon. So, I found some starter videos on TikTok on how to start yourself and all the basic tools you need and ordered them all easily on Amazon.</p>
        
        <p>Since then, I’ve just been practicing and getting better, and I have even done family and friends' nails too. Since I’ve started, I’ve been doing my own nails for 4 years now, and I have really improved. It is my favorite hobby!</p>
        
        <p>When I do my nails, it gives me some nice peaceful me-time and stimulates my brain by allowing me to use my artistic abilities to draw and create designs on my nails. Here you will find a collection of images of some of my favorite nail designs that I have created. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
